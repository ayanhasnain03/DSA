# Array Sum Calculation Program

## Problem Statement
Write a C++ program to perform the following tasks:

1. **Create an array** of size 5.
2. **Take input** from the user to populate the array.
3. **Calculate the sum** of all elements in the array.
4. **Print the total sum** after calculation.

---

## Constraints
- The array must have exactly **5** elements.
- Input values should be integers.
- Use a **loop** to take input, process the array, and display the output.

---

## Expected Input/Output

### **Input Example**
```
Enter value for index 0: 3
Enter value for index 1: 7
Enter value for index 2: 2
Enter value for index 3: 9
Enter value for index 4: 5
```

### **Output Example**
```
Sum of total elements: 26
```

## Hints
- Use a **loop** to take input and process the array elements efficiently.
- Maintain a variable to store the sum and update it during the loop.
- Use proper formatting for displaying output.
